  "8": "ADMIRAL FROGSTAR  Is perhaps the most respected PILGRIMAGE LIVESTREAMER and RUNNER OF GREAT SPEEDS in the known multiverse. An up-and-coming member of Gog-Agog's ever-shifting entertainment complex, Frogstar has quickly accumulated a legion of devoted followers and subscribers. They are known to broadcast their journeys and feats of Sorcery across many worlds and to the glyphosphere of throne itself. This mainly consists of running through walls, launching themself at high speeds through the Wheel, and completely breaking the laws of physics in several of their Demiurge's already ravaged and bug-ridden worlds in order to get to the next one faster. Frogstar is driven by a seemingly insatiable hunger to set and beat pilgrimage records which has taken them to this point - traverse all 777,777 worlds in a single Moment by collapsing all of reality in on itself, a feat they believe only the Red God to be capable of. As such, they have informally thrown in their lot with THE PYRE. Note that this does not break any pre-existing sponsorship deals or brand tie-ins. Frogstar is impatient, terse with strangers, and seems to be off in a world of their own. Their only prolonged conversation is with an audience that only they can apparently see and hear.",

Unable to settle down in the city, he would take up robbing multiversal trains: locomotives hauling passengers and supplies across the worlds and universes of the Wheel. He's garnered a reputation for himself as a permanent rail nuisance and occasional gun-witch-for-hire, and though the law always catches up with him, he has a knack for getting away some way or another. His infamy's certainly gotten to his head, too - have you seen his coat?\r\n\r\nThough not one for waxing philosophical, Al has found himself aligned with Jagganoth's forces. During a heist on a train carrying war supplies bound for Rayuba, he'd narrowly escape death with the help of Kimobe, a nihilistic monk eager for the universe's death. Indebted to the monk, and plied with some additional bribing, Al now joins Kimobe among the Pyre. At least until he dies, anyway; who knows what'll happen after that?",

Aimed towards competitors from worlds with little exposure to the wider multiverse, the shop offered a wide selection of gear at (relatively) reasonable cost. Now its inventory, and the gold devil proprietor, are at the service of Pyre.\r\n\r\nMauveline herself is quite a collector of rare and esoteric artifacts. She carries her entire shop and her copious collection inside a trans-dimensional pocket space linked to her handbag. The war for Rayuba has presented her with an excellent opportunity for expanding her collection, and she intends to take full advantage of it.\r\nOrdinarily, Mauveline wouldn’t get her hands dirty, but these are special circumstances. While not usually a fighter, one doesn’t last long in Throne merchant circles without considerable skill at the judicious application of violence. The sheer range of weapons and utility items she can pull out of her bag give her an edge of unpredictability. She leans into it to keep opponents off-balance, even if many of her artifacts seem just as hazardous to the user as the target.\r\n\r\nStumbling into Pyre’s ranks was mostly chance and some quick thinking on her part. However, she’s since found that she fits in nicely, mainly serving a logistics and support role. While not totally convinced of Jagganoth’s vision, Mauveline bears a deep resentment toward the current order. Plus, no one yells at her for “liberating” whatever trinkets she finds in the ruins.\r\nShe keeps a few escape plans ready for if things turn south or these looneys actually manage to destroy the planet, but until then she’s happy to watch things play out. Ultimately, Mauveline really wants to see what Solomon has sealed in his Tower, and she’s willing to risk everything at a chance to plunder it.",

These worms are the physical manifestation of memories that the Remembering Beast has taken from its victims, now a part of its seething collective psyche. Mnem also wears a cracked funerary mask.\r\n\r\nMnem's origins are a mystery to them.

Whatever the circumstances of their inception, they owe their creator no gratitude, for their existence is a pale and painful one. The endless clashing of half-formed memories taken from thousands of different donors is not conducive to a coherent sense of identity, and so Mnem struggles to exist in a linear and cogent manner. The missing connections and incoherence drives Mnem's insatiable hunger for more memories, hoping that they will be able to find the right ones to forge a sense of self, preferably before the influx destroys them.\r\n\r\nMnem came to Rayuba shortly after the arrival of Jagganoth's forces, having long followed behind the armies of the Red God to scavenge the bloodshed left in their wake. Having found a world filled with beings from all corners of the multiverse, they stayed behind, determined to use this opportunity to sate their hunger on the war that has come to the once-peaceful world.\r\n\r\nWhile the Remembering Beast has no particular loyalty to Pyre or its members, its monstrous nature and familiarity with the Red God's army led it to naturally fall in with their side of the war.

  "217": "Tetem is an amnesiac. Ever since losing his memory 20 years ago, he has been a scavenger and a cheap soldier for the endless skirmishes and conflicts for demiurges and otherwise. His armor is taken from the corpses of those who’ve died on the battlefield.\r\nTetem is apathetic towards war and murder, taking no joy from the task but not shying away from what must be done. However, he typically refuses to kill those who are not directly involved in the war at hand, seeing the action of fighting as permission to kill or be killed. Years on the battlefield have given him a slew of scars and keen senses, but he is still human.\r\n\r\nThen, there is THE RAT. Tetem’s forgotten past incarnate, hiding in the cavity of his right eye and awoken upon hearing of the War for Rayuba. He manifests as an alternate personality, and when not in control he whispers in Tetem’s ear. Once a master swordsman, and believing himself to be a king, The Rat believes that victory is worth any sacrifice. Deep in delusion, he forces Tetem to join the Pyre in exchange for precious memory, and the threat of further unneeded violence. He wishes to climb the ranks in order to gain power and take a share of the new world, a share which will be the culmination of all that he has sacrificed.",
  "294": "Woe betide they who read the cursed TOME OF TOAD. The eldritch book has been banned in every civilized world, but copies tend to bubble up when least expected, a new chapter of the CULT OF HUNGER is never far behind. The being now known as BILIOUS was once exiled to Rayuba, but the past is of little importance now. After biding time for years of secretive rituals and slimy experiments, the perfect opportunity to feast has come at last. Armed with surprise, fear, and fanatical determination to devour all living things in sight, Bilious and its’ cult have a shaky alliance with the all-consuming flame of RUIN. Hunger cannot be reasoned with, or surrendered to. It will never be satisfied.",
  "303": "10 years ago, these two met each other as a lonely wanderer and a starving orphan girl, where they decided to join together on a journey through the multiverse as bodyguard and charge. Only a few weeks ago, searching for Starla's mother under the assumption she might be a better influence on the girl, the father and daughter heard of the Ring of Power and its prize. They unfortunately arrived a bit too late, right when the applications closed. After the calamity of Jagganoth's appearance, they were left stranded and forced to take refuge among Bastion troops. Although the Bodyguard agrees far more with Pyre's ideals of recreating the multiverse, and is generally apathetic towards most of his Bastion allies, he chose to stay with Bastion for the sake of Starla's safety. There is, after all, no guarantee that she will safely make it to the new world.\r\n\r\nThe Bodyguard uses a style named Ox Palm primarily, while Fierce Horse Style and Head of John are more supplemental forms. Ox Palm is a form that focuses on palm strikes, and internally redirecting blunt force the user is hit with to reduce, though not nullify, the strength of the strike. Redirected force is stockpiled in the body so that it can be added to the user's own strikes, but the stockpile itself leaks and eventually dissipates on its own if not used within an hour or so.\r\nStarla, meanwhile...doesn't really have a fighting style. However, she's quite skilled at climbing, setting up/disarming traps and sneaking around (even if she prefers to go at enemies head on). She even learnt some knife throwing from Keenblade.",
